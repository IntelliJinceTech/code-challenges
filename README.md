# My Awesome Project
This is a repository of code challenges that I have compiled. I often do at least a coding challenge every day to keep my mind fresh!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:

It's great to be able to revisit and practice applying what you've learned into maybe solving the issue in different ways.
